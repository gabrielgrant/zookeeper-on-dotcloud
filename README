Zookeeper[1] maintains configuration information, naming,
and provides synchronization for distributed systems.

How to use it (standalone)
--------------------------

Clone the repo and push to dotCloud:

    git clone https://github.com/gabrielgrant/zookeeper-on-dotcloud.git
    dotcloud push myzookeeper zookeeper-on-dotcloud

At the end of the push, you can find the URL of your Zookeeper instance
by running `dotcloud info myzookeeper`

How to use it in your app
-------------------------

Add the contents of the dotcloud.yml supplied here to your own dotcloud.yml,
and copy the `zookeeper` directory into your repository. Push as
usual, and the Zookeeper URL will be made available to your app through
the standard dotCloud environment information mechanisms.
